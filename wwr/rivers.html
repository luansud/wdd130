          <h2>Yampa River</h2>
          <p>The Yampa River is terrific for rafting. It's located in Steamboat Springs and runs through Dinosaur National Monument in northwest Colorado. The area is full of dinosaur remains that can be seen everywhere. Another remarkable fact about the Yampa River is that it's the only river in Colorado that flows freely and, thus, isn't hindered by dams or diversions.</p>

          <p>Yampa River trips are typically easy, multi-day lazy floats, perfect for a peaceful getaway and sightseeing in the Yampa Canyon. The river meets the Green River at Dinosaur National Monument. Vernal, Utah, is the most popular town around Dinosaur National Monument. Vernal is where many overnight excursions meet and shuttle back. Most are multi-day camping and rafting trips; some are four or five days. During high season, it's a good idea to book your rafting adventure far in advance. (There are also shorter half-day tours that depart from downtown Steamboat Springs.)</p>
            
          <p>The best time to raft the Yampa River is from May to June. This river is perfect for rafters aged 7 and older. Sometimes the minimum age is raised to 12. There are excellent sections of Class III and IV rapids for adventurous rafters.</p>
