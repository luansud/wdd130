          <h2>Yampa River</h2>
          <p>The Yampa River is terrific for rafting. It's located in Steamboat Springs and runs through Dinosaur National Monument in northwest Colorado. The area is full of dinosaur remains that can be seen everywhere. Another remarkable fact about the Yampa River is that it's the only river in Colorado that flows freely and, thus, isn't hindered by dams or diversions.</p>

          <p>Yampa River trips are typically easy, multi-day lazy floats, perfect for a peaceful getaway and sightseeing in the Yampa Canyon. The river meets the Green River at Dinosaur National Monument. Vernal, Utah, is the most popular town around Dinosaur National Monument. Vernal is where many overnight excursions meet and shuttle back. Most are multi-day camping and rafting trips; some are four or five days. During high season, it's a good idea to book your rafting adventure far in advance. (There are also shorter half-day tours that depart from downtown Steamboat Springs.)</p>
            
          <p>The best time to raft the Yampa River is from May to June. This river is perfect for rafters aged 7 and older. Sometimes the minimum age is raised to 12. There are excellent sections of Class III and IV rapids for adventurous rafters.</p>

          <h2>Animas River</h2>
          <p>Durango is the most populous mountain town in southwestern Colorado, with approximately 20,000 residents. This historic city may be best known for its narrow-gauge railroad, but the Animas River provides energy and entertainment year-round.</p>

          <p>Animas River is 126 miles long and is a tributary of the San Juan and Colorado Rivers. Since the river does not freeze over in winter, it serves as critical habitat for resident bald eagles. The Animas River is fantastic for beginners, families, groups, and those who have rafted previously.</p>
            
          <p>The best thing about the Animas River is that you can find lazy rafts and wild rapids on both half-day and full-day tours. The Lower Animas River runs through downtown Durango and is the easier of the two sections. It's an adrenaline-packed family ride as you sail the artificial rapids at Durango Whitewater Park. The Upper Animas River originates just north of town, near the mountain resort of Purgatory in Durango. It is the longest continuous stretch of commercially operated Class IV and V rapids in the nation at more than 30 miles.</p>

          <p>The best time to raft the Animas River is between May and July. It is appropriate for rafters aged 7 and above. However, the minimum age may increase to 12, depending on water levels.</p>

          <img src="images/rivers//Clear Creek.jpg" alt="Clear Creek rafting River image">
          <h2>Clear Creek</h2>
          <p>For those who are closer to Denver, Clear Creek is the best choice. It is one of Colorado's most popular lazy rivers, conveniently located off I-70. Don't let the “creek” moniker sway your opinion; this is one of Colorado's best rafting sections. Young adults looking for their first time on the river should try the Gold Rush section. Intermediate rafters should try the Upper Colorado or Lower Canyon tour for an adrenaline rush.</p>

          <p>The best time to raft Clear Creek is between May and September. If you want to raft Clear Creek Canyon, we recommend going in May, June, or July. Clear Creek is appropriate for ages 6+. However, the minimum age can increase during certain times of the year as the river swells and becomes more hazardous. If you're looking for a more exhilarating experience, Clear Creek presents many options for adrenaline seekers – even a Class V section for experienced rafters.</p>
