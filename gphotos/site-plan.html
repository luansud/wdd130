          My name is Glayce Felizola, I'm 26 years old and I was born and raised in Arapiraca, Alagoas. I am married to Lu達 Felizola. 
          I've always had a lot of love for photography because it's always been present in my life, I've always liked to photograph my friends and bring out the beauty they had and that they often didn't realize. 
          I love the way people feel after contemplating my look, I am passionate about affective photography because it portrays special moments in people's lives and makes these moments be recorded forever.
          My work goes far beyond a simple photo, it's being able to freeze the real love of each moment.
